This README file is for a web based calender app. Agile sprint methdology was integrated in this group project. The majority of the code is written in javascript using Visual studio code. 
Our team collaborated over Visual studio code live share to collaborate in real time and continous integration was done through Github Workflow.


APP DESCRIPTION
--------------------------

The target audience for the app is students. It has features like:

1. Creating user accounts
2. Creating Events 
3. It provides a view of the events on the calender itself which are colour coordinated according to the time they are due
4. A listedd view of all created events which are categorized according to today's and this month's events and all events.
5. You can also edit the previously created events
6. You can add other users to an event you create to help users collaborate with each other.

TESTING
--------------------------

We used: 

MOCHA
CHAI
TRAVIS CI 

for working unit tests. A test driven development (TDD) methodology was used, beginning with writting 5 intial failing tests before writting the actual code. The current number of tests is 7 and we are still working on more.

--------------------------


This project took us 4 weeks of work, consisting 4 total sprints. Honestly, we did face some problems during the collaboration as we couldn't meet in person and we were all new to this kind of project development.
The aim of this project was to create a school/university student-focused calender app while learning Agile project management, Test driven development and continous integration and delivery.

Some other platforms we used in this project were, 
Discord for communication
Trello for Kanban Collaboration 
Google docs and slides to share files and create pitch presentations.
